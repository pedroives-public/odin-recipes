        <h2>Directions 👨‍🍳</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Combine beans, onion, ham, calabresa, 3 cloves garlic, salt, cumin,
            black pepper, and bay leaf in a pressure cooker; cover with water to
            fill line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent
            according to manufacturer's instructions. Cook at high pressure
            until regulator is gently rocking, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce pressure
            to low. Cook, adding water halfway if needed, until beans are tender
            and water is reduced to your liking, about 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off heat. Let pressure release naturally according to
            manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock lid and remove.
            Let feijoada cool until ready to serve.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute remaining
            1 clove garlic and collard greens until just tender, about 2
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place cassava flour in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and
            stir until toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir in butter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve feijoada with the collards-garlic mixture, toasted cassava
            flour, rice, orange wedges, and cilantro.
          </li>
